Note that this code assumes that you have already defined the `sender` and `receiver` variables with the IDs of the accounts to transfer the money between. Additionally, the `amount` variable should be a Python integer representing the amount of money being transferred.

Also note that this code uses pandas to read and write data from the database, which can be useful for data transformations and queries, but it may not be the most efficient way to do so in all cases. If you have a large amount of data to transfer, you may want to consider using SQLAlchemy's `execute()` method instead of pandas to perform the updates.
